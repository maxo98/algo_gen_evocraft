    "If you're into game design (or maybe someting more exotic, like computer-generated art), you may have needed to generate large random patterns. Maybe because you want infinite levels, or because you're just making randomly-generated levels for your cool roguelike, or you're ~~lazy~~ pressed for time and would like some computer help to generate textures.\n",

    "A typical technique is to create these using [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise). Minecraft, for instance, uses a variant of it to generate its sprawling worlds. But Perlin noise is only appropriate if you don't have very strong constraints between the elements of your generated structure. For instance, if you're generating 2D platformer levels, you'll want ladders to always start and finish at platforms. You could post-process your random levels to do that, but it may become very tricky if your constraints are hard to tack onto a generated thing! \n",

    "[Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse), or WFC, tries to solve this by integrating any constraints at generation time. If you've never seen examples before, I encourage you to read [the WFC readme](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/blob/master/README.md), which has some great examples of what WFC can do. Another example of WFC I really like is the appropriately-named [Wave Function Collapse](https://marian42.itch.io/wfc), a 3D WFC-based random city generator.\n",

Keeping only the four \"T\" tiles, for instance, results in a much lower success rate, as WFC runs into contradictions and quits. (You should still be able to get something out if you run WFC ~10 times).\n",

A more sophisticated option is to implement _backtracking_: when we hit a contradiction, we go back to a previous state and try again. This allows us to keep some of the already computed output image, while hopefully throwing out enough bad choices to get rid of the contradictory situation.\n",
